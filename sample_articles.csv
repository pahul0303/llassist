"Cognitive Planning for Object Goal Navigation using Generative AI Models","Recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offer new possi bilities for integrating cognitive planning into robotic systems. In this work, we present a novel framework for solving the object goal navigation problem that generates efficient exploration strategies. Our approach enables a robot to navi gate unfamiliar environments by leveraging LLMs and LVLMs to understand the semantic structure of the scene. To address the challenge of representing com plex environments without overwhelming the system, we propose a 3D modular scene representation, enriched with semantic descriptions. This representation is dynamically pruned using an LLM-based mechanism, which filters irrelevant information and focuses on task-specific data. By combining these elements, our system generates high-level sub-goals that guide the robotâ€™s exploration toward the target object. We validate our approach in simulated environments, demonstrat ing its ability to enhance object search efficiency while maintaining scalability in complex settings."
